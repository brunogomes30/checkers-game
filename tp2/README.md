  Living room with a computer desk with a coffee mug on top, that, as Schrödinger's cat, might me empty or full. Someone famous using the computer to be hipnotized by the 80's top hit 'Never Gonna Give You Up'.There's a small gift stuffed under the table under a camouflage tent. Next to the table there's a sofa with two famous characters holding hands and throwing paper planes. Theey are moving around the room into various positions There are paintings on the walls, and a small lamp, as well as a decorative barrel in the corner. There are plants scattered around the room that appear to have some sort of growth genetic mutation. In the center, we can find a table full of empty coffee mugs and two chairs.
